# What is it?

Disclaimer: THIS IS BETA CODE

Ruby code (with zero dependencies) for debugging native x86/x86_64 bit Linux binaries using the ptrace API. ARM support is planned but not yet finished.

Rtrace ships with Eucalyptus. A fully functional scriptable debugger that doubles as a unit test for Rtrace. Eucalyptus is scriptable and extendable, its not just a test harness. It ships with real world examples that work out of the box.

When I said "no dependencies" I really meant it. Not a single third-party gem is required to use rtrace or Eucalyptus out of the box.

Rtrace contains an optional ELF parser that requires the bindata gem. The parser supports 32/64bit ELF objects but it has not been well tested. I welcome pull requests that improve its stability.

Rtrace is inspired by the Ragweed::Wraptux code which I wrote several years ago.

# TODO

* Rtrace currently lacks support for DWARF and has no disassembler. These things are a little beyond the scope of Rtrace. However Eucalyptus could see support for these in the near term. This would most likely include hooks for the Capstone engine.
